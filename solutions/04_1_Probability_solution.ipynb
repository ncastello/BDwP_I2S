    "Statistical inference rests upon probability. Because we can very rarely say anything meaningful with absolute certainty from data, we use probabilistic language to make quantitative statements about data. In this chapter, you will learn how to think probabilistically about discrete quantities, those that can only take certain values, like integers. It is an important first step in building the probabilistic language necessary to think statistically.\n",

    "... but there are millions of htese flowers on the planet. **Can you tell me the mean petal length of all the flowers of that species?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we measure another 50 flowers, I get a similar, but quantitatively different set of measurements . **Can now you tell me what value I would get for the mean petal length if I measured another 50 flowers?** We just do not have the language to do that without probability.\n",

    "# Exercise 3.  How many defaults might we expect?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say a bank made 100 mortgage loans (_prestamos hipotecarios_).  It is possible that anywhere between 0 and 100 of the loans will be defaulted upon. You would like to know the probability of getting a given number of defaults, given that the probability of a default is ```p = 0.05```. To investigate this, you will do a simulation. You will perform 100 Bernoulli trials using the ```perform_bernoulli_trials()``` function you wrote in the previous exercise and record how many defaults we get. Here, a success is a default. (Remember that the word \"success\" just means that the Bernoulli trial evaluates to True, i.e., did the loan recipient default?) You will do this for another 100 Bernoulli trials. And again and again until we have tried it 1000 times. Then, you will plot a histogram describing the probability of the number of defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "> - Seed the random number generator to ```42```.\n",
    "> - Initialize ```n_defaults```, an empty array, using ```np.empty()```. It should contain 1000 entries, since we are doing 1000 simulations.\n",
    "> - Write a ```for``` loop with ```1000``` iterations to compute the number of defaults per 100 loans using the ```perform_bernoulli_trials()``` function. It accepts two arguments: the number of trials ```n``` - in this case 100 - and the probability of success ```p``` - in this case the probability of a default, which is ```0.05```. On each iteration of the loop store the result in an entry of ```n_defaults```.\n",
    "> - Plot a histogram of ```n_defaults```. Include the ```normed=True``` keyword argument so that the height of the bars of the histogram indicate the probability.\n",
    "> - Show your plot.\n"
