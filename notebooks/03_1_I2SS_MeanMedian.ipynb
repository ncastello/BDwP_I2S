    "\n",
    "We have seen that histograms, bee swarm plots, and ECDFs provide effective summaries of data. But in data science is mandatory to summarize data even more succinctly, say in one or two numbers, at least. These numerical summaries are not by any stretch a substitute for the graphical methods we have been employing, but they do take up a lot less real estate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to the elecgtion data from the swing states again. If we could summarize the percentage of the votes for Obama at the county level in Pennylvania in one number, what would we choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/beeswarm_plot.png\",width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first number that pops into my mind is **the mean**. The mean is the sum of all the data, divided by the number n of the data points\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} \\right) = \\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+\\dots+x_n}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the mean for a given state is just the average percentage of votes over the counties. If we add the means as horizontal lines to the bee swarm plot, we see that they are a reasonable summary of the data.\n",

    "### ```mean``` with NumPy\n",
    "To compute the mean of a set of data, we call the ```np.mean()``` function. Here used to compute the mean county-level vote for Obama in Pennsylvania\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: import numpy as np\n",
    "In [2]: np.mean( dem_share_PA )\n",

    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ```mean``` remark\n",
    "- The mean is a useful statistic and easy to calculare, but a major problem is that <font color=\"red\">it is heavily influenced by outliers</font> (i.e. data points whose value is far greater or less than most of the rest of the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: the ```median```\n",
    "We might like a summary statistic that is immune to extreme data. The median provides exactly that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The median is the middle value of a data set.** It is defined by how it is calculated: sort the data and choosing the datum in the middle. Because it is derived from the ranking of sorted data, and not on the values of the data, the median is immune to data that take on extreme values. \n",

    "\n",
    "### ```median``` with NumPy\n",
    "To compute the **median** of a set of data, we use the ```np.median()``` function. Here used to compute the median county-level vote for Obama in Utah\n",
