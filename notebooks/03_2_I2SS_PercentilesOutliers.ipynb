    "# 3.2 Percentiles, outliers, and box plots\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As all of you probably now, the median is the special name for the 50th percentile; that is 50% of the data are less than the median. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the 25th percentile is the value of the data point that is greater than 25% of the sorted data, and so on for any other percentile we want.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/ECDF_percentile_ex.png\",width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ```percentile``` with NumPy\n",
    "Percertiles are useful summary statistics, and can be computed by calling the function ```np.percentile```. We just pass a list of the percentiles we want, **percentiles, not fractions**, and it returns the data that match those percentiles\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "In [1]: pd_data = pd.read_csv(\"data/2008_swing_states.csv\")\n",
    "In [2]: pd_data_PA = pd_data[pd_data['state']==\"PA\"]\n",
    "In [3]: dem_share_PA = pd_data_PA[\"dem_share\"].values\n",
    "    \n",
    "In [4]: np.percentile( dem_share_PA, [25,50,75])\n",
    "Out[4]: array([ 37.3025,  43.185 ,  49.925])\n",

    "We now have three summary statistics. The hole point of summary statistics was to keep things concise, but we are starting to get a lot of numbers here.\n",

    "### 2.1 Box plots: interquartile range (IQR)\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=red> Dealing with this issue is where quantitative EDA meets graphical EDA. Box plots were invented by John Tukey himself to display some of the salient features of a data set based on percentiles.\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/box_plot_percentile_ex.png\",width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see a box pot showing Obama's vote share from states east and west of Mississipi River. \n",
    "- The center of the box is the median, which we know is the percentile of the data\n",
    "- The edges of the box are the 25th and 75th percentile\n",
    "- The total height of the box contains the middle 50% of the data, and is called the **interquartile range**, or **IQR**\n",
    "- The whiskers extend a distance of $$1.5\\times IQR$$ or to the extent of the data, whichever is less extreme\n",
    "- Finally, any points outside of the whiskers are plotted as individual points, **which we often demarcate as outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Outlier Criterion\n",
    "While there is no single definition for an outlier, **being more than 2 IQRs away from the median** is a common criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that **an outlier is not necessarily an erroneous data point**. You should not assume an outlier is erroneous unless you have some known reason to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, since there is zero evidence of any substantial voter fraud in the United States in 2008 elections, these outliers are not erroneous. They are just data points with extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the number of data are very large and bee swarm plots are too cluttered, as the one we shown in last section\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/beeswarm_limitation_ex.png\",width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "box plots are a great alternative. It makes sense, then, that constructing a box plot using ```seaborn``` is exactly the same as making a bee swarm plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating a box plot: percentiles\n",
    "We just call the function ```sns.boxplot()``` with arguments the values for x and y-axis:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "sns.set()\n",
    "\n",
    "east_west = pd_data['east_west'].values\n",
